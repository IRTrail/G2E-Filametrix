# G2E and Filametrix
## _Modifications for the G2E to have a Filametrix cutter...and a filament sensor option...or two._  
### Thanks to sundee, jmaurin, jelliebean, gsx8829, CheeseFrog, and kinematicdigit for suggestions and feedback. Thanks to any of you who have come here and print these parts. You're what it's all about.  
I am on discord @ silverback_attack.  
Understand there is no CAD released for the G2 stuff. Reverse engineering it is a total PITA. Ergo, there will likely be some slicer complaints because the stls aren't "water tight". I have done my best. If you want the reverse engineered files I used to start these mods, they're in the aptly named folder. They are not perfect clones because of some intricacies in the CAD process that are difficult to overcome. But, they're likely indistinguisible when printed.  
#### Use at your own risk. It's not my fault your sister is ugly or your tongue hurts when you lick a 9V battery...or anything else. Just saying.  

### Non-sensor Config:

### Single Sensor Config:

### Twin Sensor (Twinsor) Config:

## There are now three versions. One is non-sensored, one has a single sensor, the other has two sensors. See the respective folders for CAD, 3MF, and STL files.
Unless otherwise stated below, all the build notes from the G2E and Filametrix apply. If you look things over, you should get the idea.

## There are two arm versions.  
One is a wide version which uses the screw in the ADXL hole for a stop.  
The other is a stylized arm which has an integral stop which does not use the screw. However, it does obscure the ADXL hole somewhat.  
-- I have been told it is a PITA to install with the spring and washers and all without the screw stop. (I didn't know there were supposed to be washers!)

## These are the measurements for the Rapido 1 with the Twinsor.  
Other versions use the same measurements, I.E. the Single Sensor has the same measurement, just not the other switch.  
These are taken from CAD and are just calculations for reference.

### NOTES:  
I have included all the necessary parts in each folder.  
They should be oriented to print with no issues.  
The necessary supports are included, and should be discarded after printing.  
The standard Voron print settings should work quite well here.  
I only have a Rapido hotend, thus, I have not updated the other hot end cages. I will work on them in the future (in order of the squeakiest wheel).
