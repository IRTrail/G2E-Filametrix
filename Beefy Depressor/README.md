# Beefy Depressor
#### With respect to Sorted for the original design.
So, you have done countless swaps and find that the cutter is weak, seems to have no vigor, and just doesn't cut it anymore. I get it. It happens. You need a ***BEEFY*** depressor. I have your back my dude.

There's no counterbored or chamfered slots in this one. Just pure 100% raw Angus Waygu BEEF. Use M3 x 10 bolts in each location. Add a washer to each one to decrease chance of pull-through.

Now, you should have no more bull.
