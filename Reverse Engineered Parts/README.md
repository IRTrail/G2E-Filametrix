# Reverse engineered G2E front and rear bodies.
#### Because STLs are ok for printing, but not good for modding.
I reverse engineered the G2E front and rear bodies in Solidworks, so I have a good baseline set of parts for modding. They are as close to a perfect representation as I can get. Some of the radii aren't perfect. I think some of it comes from the fact that there is evidence the G2E is a mod of the regular CW2...or I suspect it is. There are very small witnesses that the G2E parts are mods of other parts, which aren't readily apparent unless you've spent WAY too much time in CAD. At any rate, some of that made it difficult to replicate the complex multifillet regions. They should function fine though.
