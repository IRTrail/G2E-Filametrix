##### NOTHING HERE HAS BEEN TESTED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Things in work:
- Reverse engineered the G2E extruder in Solidworks to have a good baseline set of parts to work from. See the aptly named "Reverse Engineered Parts" folder for those.
- Created a baseline setup for filament cutting.
-- This has numerous fixes, including reworking the cutter arm such that it has a bump stop in the rear half of the hot end case. This eliminates the screw stop. I also changed the overall shape of the arm to fit more in the aesthetic of the Stealthburner.
-- Reworked the front and rear Rapido cases to have a better mounting lug and use a M3 socket head screw instead of a countersunk screw. I have far more M3 SHCS than I do M3 CSHS. Also matched the profile to the front case mounting point.
-- Improved the blade holder cavity for better tolerance in all three parts in contact with it.
-- Other small changes which just cleaned up the CAD a bit. Probably not noticable to the human eye when printed.
- The Twinsor is the focus of work right now.
-- Other variants my be lagging behind the bleeding edge. Everyone seems to like the Twinsor and I haven't seen as much interest in the baseline or single sensor version.
